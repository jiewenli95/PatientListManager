The Overview Page contains every patient in the team with patient information, tasks with the progress associated with each patient, and a real-time collaborative text area for each patient card for sharing messages among users. The shared text area allows users to edit the text field while collaborating with other users in real-time which is a simple version of Google Docs.

Users are able to add different tasks for different patients in the team and modify the progress for each showing task if needed. Once there is a new task added to the team that the users belong to, every member of the team will receive a message showing the task type and the patient that is needed for the task.


### Outstanding Tasks
